Section 3.7.4: Investigating the Distribution of the Impulse Responses
by Simulation Techniques

Let y be the data. Let M(y,theta) be the model. Let theta* and Mcov* be
the estimated coefficients and the corresponding covariance matrix of
the estimated coefficients.

We can compute the standard errors by the two following methods:

METHOD 1
--------
If we assume the following assumption theta~N(theta*,Mcov*), the algorithm is

  step 1: We simulate Ns paths of the coefficients (for example, RND_theta
          = rndn2(theta,Mcov,Ns);).
  step 2: For each path of the simulated coefficients, we perform the
          impulse analysis.
  step 3: Then, we compute the standard errors of the simulated responses

METHOD 2
--------
We suppose that the Model M(y,theta) can be put into the state space form.
The algorithm is

  step 1: We bootstrap Ns paths of the data according to the model M(y,theta)
         with the procedure bootstrap_SSM.
  step 2: For each path of the simulated data, we estimate the coefficients
          of the model M and perform the impulse analysis.
  step 3: Then, we compute the standard errors of the simulated responses
